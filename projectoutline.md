Important Implementation Notes (matching style & behavior)

Use the same design tokens & components across Home and Rooms pages to ensure a unified look.

Reuse the RoomCard component with small variations (preview vs full card).

Make filters server-driven and UI-driven but visually identical to the Home quick-book controls.

Images & videos must have alt text, ordering fields, and optional captions for accessibility.

Calendar uses blocked/unavailable styling consistent with rest of site color tokens (e.g., red for unavailable, green for available).

Booking form must include children count and the stepper should be used across site (Home quick-book and Room sticky booking card).

üÜï Guest Profile logic: automatically created/updated after each booking; used to track visit history, store preferences, and personalize future bookings.

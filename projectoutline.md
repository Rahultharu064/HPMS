13. Implementation notes & suggestions

Use Lucide icons for status icons (CheckCircle, AlertCircle, User, Wrench).

For avatars use a component that accepts profilePictureUrl and falls back to initials.

Cropper library suggestion: any modern React cropper (allow circle or square).

Thumbnails: generate server-side on upload for performance.

Consider signed URLs for private storage.

WebSocket (socket.io or WS) for real-time updates later.

Validate uploads on frontend (size/type) and backend (mime-type, virus scan if needed).

Important Implementation Notes (matching style & behavior)

Use the same design tokens & components across Home and Rooms pages to ensure a unified look.

Reuse the RoomCard component with small variations (preview vs full card).

Make filters server-driven and UI-driven but visually identical to the Home quick-book controls.

Images & videos must have alt text, ordering fields, and optional captions for accessibility.

Calendar uses blocked/unavailable styling consistent with rest of site color tokens (e.g., red for unavailable, green for available).

Booking form must include children count and the stepper should be used across site (Home quick-book and Room sticky booking card).

üÜï Guest Profile logic: automatically created/updated after each booking; used to track visit history, store preferences, and personalize future bookings.

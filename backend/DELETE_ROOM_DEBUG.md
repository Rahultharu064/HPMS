# 🔧 Room Deletion Debug Guide

## 🚨 **Issue**: "Failed to delete room"

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue was in the backend `deleteRoom` function. The problem was:

1. **Foreign Key Constraints**: The database has foreign key relationships between `room` and related tables (`amenity`, `image`, `video`)
2. **Incorrect Deletion Order**: The original code tried to delete the room first, which violated foreign key constraints
3. **Missing Related Records**: The code didn't include `amenity` in the query, so amenities weren't being deleted

## ✅ **Fixed Implementation**

### **Backend Changes** (`backend/src/controllers/roomController.js`):

```javascript
// OLD (BROKEN) - Tried to delete room directly
await prisma.room.delete({ where: { id } });

// NEW (FIXED) - Delete related records first
// 1. Delete amenities
await prisma.amenity.deleteMany({ where: { roomId: id } });

// 2. Delete images  
await prisma.image.deleteMany({ where: { roomId: id } });

// 3. Delete videos
await prisma.video.deleteMany({ where: { roomId: id } });

// 4. Finally delete the room
await prisma.room.delete({ where: { id } });
```

### **Enhanced Logging**:
- Added detailed console logs for each step
- Better error handling with specific error details
- File removal logging

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **1. Start Backend Server**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### **2. Test with Node.js Script**
```bash
cd backend
node test-delete.js
```

### **3. Test via Frontend**
1. Go to `http://localhost:5173/owner-admin`
2. Click "Rooms"
3. Click "Test API" to verify connection
4. Try deleting a room

### **4. Check Backend Console**
Look for these log messages:
```
Attempting to delete room with ID: 123
Found room: Deluxe Suite with 2 images, 1 videos, 3 amenities
Removing image file: uploads/images/123.jpg
Deleting related records...
Deleted amenities
Deleted images  
Deleted videos
Deleted room successfully
```

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue 1: Foreign Key Constraint Violation**
**Error**: `Foreign key constraint failed`
**Solution**: ✅ Fixed - Now deletes related records first

### **Issue 2: Room Not Found**
**Error**: `Room not found`
**Solution**: Check if room ID exists, refresh the rooms list

### **Issue 3: File System Errors**
**Error**: `Failed to remove file`
**Solution**: Check file permissions, files are removed but deletion continues

### **Issue 4: Database Connection**
**Error**: `Database connection failed`
**Solution**: Check if database is running, verify DATABASE_URL

## 🔧 **Database Schema Understanding**

```sql
-- Foreign key relationships
room (id) ← amenity (roomId)
room (id) ← image (roomId)  
room (id) ← video (roomId)

-- Deletion order (due to foreign keys)
1. Delete amenity records
2. Delete image records
3. Delete video records  
4. Delete room record
```

## 📋 **Verification Checklist**

- [ ] Backend server running on port 5000
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Room exists in database
- [ ] No foreign key constraint errors
- [ ] Files removed from filesystem
- [ ] Related records deleted
- [ ] Room record deleted
- [ ] Success response sent

## 🚀 **Quick Test Commands**

```bash
# Test backend directly
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/rooms/1

# Check if room exists
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rooms/1

# List all rooms
curl http://localhost:5000/api/rooms
```

The room deletion should now work properly! 🎯
